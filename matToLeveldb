# convert .mat file to leveldb
## .mat file contain the RGB image and their labels
### [python convert](https://github.com/PeterPan1990/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/io.py)

**pipline:rewrite the data to binary, then use **

* use fwrite to write .mat file into .bin file, refer to [matToBinary.m](), you will got 
train_batch.bin and test_batch.bin, or you can make mulitiple batches just like cifar10 data convert process
**Notes: caffe or leveldb use row prior image data, becareful when you reshape to matrix to vector**

* change the [convert_svhn_data.cpp]() file, just varaibles like: kCIFARSize,kCIFARImageNBytes,kCIFARTestBatchSize,
kCIFARTrainBatches, and some path varaible.

* change the [create_svhn.sh]() file, just the path need to change

* make the project at root_caffe dir, use: make command

* execute create_svhn.sh file at root_caffe, you will get leveldb at /example/svhn
